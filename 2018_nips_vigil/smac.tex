\subsection{Simplified MAC network}
Our proposed modification to the MAC network is based on two heuristic
simplifications of the equations governing a MAC cell. 
First, we observed that when looking at the equations of different units
together as a whole, we notice that there are several affine transformations
that are applied in sequence (with no activation in-between).
Therefore they can actually be combined to form a single affine transformation.
The second observation uses the following heuristic argument:
suppose there is a single affine transformation which preserves the number
of dimensions. Then one can assume that the transformation is invertible
so as to avoid a loss in the information. Applying this principle to 
equations in the read and write unit results in eliminating an affine
operation of the knowledge base in the recurrent network. Instead we compute
this operation on the knowledge base right after we apply the 2 
trainable CNN layers (i.e. prior to the reasoning steps). This results
in a significant savings in training time, as our experiments demonstrate
below, without incurring too much drop in accuracy.

\subsection*{Control Unit}

\begin{align*}
	&q_i = U_i^{[d \times 2d]} q + b_i^{[d]}  \tag{c0} \\
	\cline{1-2}
	&cq_i = W_{\textsf{cq}}^{[d \times d]} c_{i-1} + q_i  \tag{c1} \\
	&ca_{is} = W_{\textsf{ca}}^{[1 \times d]} (cq_i \odot \mathbf{cw}_s)  \tag{c2.1}\\
	&cv_{is} = \textrm{softmax}(ca_{is}) \tag{c2.2}\\
	&\mathbf{c}_i = \sum_s cv_{is} \, \mathbf{cw}_s  \tag{c2.3}
\end{align*}
Only eqn.~(c0) above is \emph{position dependent}

\subsection*{Read Unit}

\begin{align*}
	&\mathbf{\tk}_{hw} = U_{\textsf{proj}}^{[d \times d]} \mathbf{k}_{hw} + b_{\textsf{proj}}^{[d]} \tag{r0} \\
	\cline{1-2}
	&I_{ihw} = \mathbf{m}_{i-1} \odot \mathbf{\tk}_{hw} \tag{r1} \\
	&I'_{ihw} = \mathbf{\tk}_{hw}  + W_{\textsf{I}}^{[d \times d]} I_{ihw} + b_{\textsf{I}}^{[d]}  \tag{r2} \\
	&ra_{ihw} = W_{\textsf{ra}}^{[1 \times d]} (\mathbf{c}_i \odot I'_{ihw})  \tag{r3.1}\\
	&rv_{ihw} = \textrm{softmax}(ra_{ihw}) \tag{r3.2}\\
	&\mathbf{r}_i = \sum_s rv_{ihw} \, \mathbf{\tk}_{hw}  \tag{r3.3}
\end{align*}

Note that $\mathbf{\tk}_{hw}$ can be \emph{precomputed} before the reasoning steps.

\subsection*{Write Unit}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{m}_i = W_{\textsf{m}}^{[d \times d]} \mathbf{r}_i + b_{\textsf{m}}^{[d]} \tag{w1}
\end{equation}
