\section{Experiments}

We propose to further analyse MACâ€™s generalization and transfer learning abilities by testing it on the CLEVR-CoGenT dataset. It is synthesized in the same way as CLEVR but contains two conditions: in Condition A, all cubes are gray, blue, brown, or yellow and all cylinders are red, green, purple, or cyan; in Condition B, cubes and cylinders swap color palettes. Both conditions contain spheres of all colors.
