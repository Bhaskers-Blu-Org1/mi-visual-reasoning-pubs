\subsection{Contributions}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Time aspect}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Learning the temporal association - grounding the time-related words with meaning
\item Learning the concept of time
\item time context being by-product of gates
\end{itemize}

\item Visual Grounding:
\begin{itemize}
\item Learning complex, multi-step reasoning that involves grounding of words and visual representations/objects
\item 
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Selective Attention Memory}:
\begin{itemize}
\item updating the memory content only with relevant visual information depending on the temporal context
\item content based and location based addressing for reading and writing
\item new memory interface/gating designed in such a way enabling the model to control the flow of current visual information and content of the memory in a selective way

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
